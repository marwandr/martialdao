# Martial Dao - A Brawler Game using UDP
Made for the subject Computer Networks. Using the PyGame, pickle and websocket libraries.
There's still some bugs such as it only working locally currently, and not with different IP addresses;
and when disconnecting the server recovery does not work properly.

# Credits
Music used is credited in the code, sprites are made by myself.
